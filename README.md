# Project-2


## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK) IN AWS
---

Project 2 covers similar concepts as Project 1 and helps give a better understanding of deploying Web solutions using LEMP stacks.

In this project we implemented a similar stack, but with an alternative Web Server – NGINX, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the Internet.

We achived this by following the following steps:

Step 1 – installing the nginx web server


Step 2 — installing mysql


Step 3 – installing php


Step 4 — configuring nginx to use php processor


Step 5 – testing php with nginx


Step 6 – retrieving data from mysql database with php
